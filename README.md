## Introduce 
A TikTok influencer captures a video narrating her experience of returning to her rural family home during winter. Concerned about her being cold, her mother removes the electric heater from her room and replaces it with a coal stove to keep her warm at night. Following the video's release, commenters advise the influencer to remove the coal stove from her room at night to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. Heeding the advice from her followers, she takes the coal stove out. However, her sister, unaware of the risks, moves the coal stove into her own room during the night. Tragically, the next day, her sister and her sister's child are hospitalized due to carbon monoxide poisoning
